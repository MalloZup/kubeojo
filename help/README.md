# Kubeojo explained live!

## Let's have a look:

The balls represent test-failures over a period of time. 
Bigger balls are tests that need to be rewritten or your product is weak on that category.
You can order your tests in sub-categories. ( here we have a hypotetical docker-testsuite)

## So we can zoom to search particular failures of sub-categories.

## Balls are changing all the time.

Since kubeojo will fetch testsresults overtime, the size of the balls will increase if a tests fails.

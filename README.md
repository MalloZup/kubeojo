# How to run kubeojo

At this point kubeojo is under the dev. phase not 1.0 version, as soon a version is ready i will update the doc for running kubeojo.
( you can still pick up issues from GitHub if you want to contribute for 1.0 version) 

# What is kubeojo?

Each project nowdays have a testsuite that is running on CI for ensure it stability.

When having big testsuites, there are always "brittle tests", tests that fail like 1 time on 10 Runs.

Kubeojo examine methodically and in detail your tests failures:
storing the results and  visualizing the "brittle tests" help to detect this tests and fix them.

Kubeojo will track and visualize this tests with phoenix and D3.js.


# Configuration:

In order to use kubeojo, you need to have 2 yaml files configured.

1) Jenkins credentials.
`kubeojo/kubeojo/config/jenkins_credentials.yml`

as password you can use the a Jenkins Token.
```yaml
jenkins_url: "https://i_love_opensuse.ci.com/"

```

2) Jenkins Jobs you want to analyze.

`kubeojo/kubeojo/config/jenkins_jobs.yml`

Insert here the jobs name you want to analyze the tests-results.

**Important**: your jobs need to export tests in **junit-format**, so that kubeojo can fetch the junit_results.

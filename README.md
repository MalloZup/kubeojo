# What is kubeojo?

Each project nowdays have a testsuite that is running on CI for ensure it stability.

When having big testsuites, there are always "brittle tests", tests that fail like 1 time on 10 Runs.

Kubeojo examine methodically and in detail your tests failures:
storing the results and  visualizing the "brittle tests" help to detect this tests and fix them.

Kubeojo will track and visualize this tests with phoenix and D3.js.



# Configuration:
